## CS250 - Agile and Scrum 

This repository contains my Sprint Review and Retrospective deliverable from the CS250 course. Through this project, I applied Agile and Scrum principles to the SNHU Travel development project
and reflected on how Agile practices support effective teamwork, adaptability, and value delivery.

## Interpreting User Needs and User Stories

I interpret user needs by focusing on what the user is trying to accomplish and why it matters, rather than immediately jumping to technical solutions. Creating user stories helps break down
complex requirements into clear, customer-focused goals written from the user's perspective.

In the SNHU Travel project, user stories allowed the team to prioritize functionality that delivered the most value first and ensured development stayed aligned with user expectations. User 
stories also made requirements easier to estimate, discuss, and adapt as feedback was received.

## My Approach to Developing Programs and Agile Processes

I approach program development incrementally, building and improving functionality through small, manageable pieces of work. Agile processes such as sprint planning, daily standups, sprint reviews, 
and retrospectives support this approach by encouraging continous feedback and improvement. 

Moving forward, I plan to continue using Agile practices like backlog refinement, iterative development, and regular retrospectives to remain adaptable and responsive to change while maintaining 
steady progress toward project goals. 

## Being a Good Team Member in Software Development

Being a good team member in sofware development means communicating clearly, collaborating openly, and being accountable for both individual work and team outcomes. A strong team member supports
others, participates actively in Scrum events, and remains flexible when priorities change.

During the SNHU Travel Project, effective teamwork relied on transparency, respectful communication, and a shared commitmenmt to delivering value to the user. These qualities help build trust 
and enable teams to succeed in Agile environments.
